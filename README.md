# CMake SFML Project Template
Thanks to the guys at SFML, I get to easily use their CMake template to get SFML running pretty quick!

#The Raycaster
A simple, DDA (Digital Differential Analysis) textured raycaster. Textures are still a bit weird and buggy. I made this project out of the fun for learning some of the interesting maths behind it, and also to challenge myself to more barebones tools. It's pretty fun to work on!
